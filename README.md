# Text Classification Using Naive Bayes Model

Text Classification Using Naive Bayes Model is a project that aims to classify text documents into predefined categories using the Naive Bayes algorithm. This project provides a simple and effective way to automatically categorize text data, making it useful for various applications such as sentiment analysis, spam detection, and topic classification.

## Description

The Text Classification Using Naive Bayes Model project leverages the Naive Bayes algorithm, a probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem, to classify text documents. The project follows these steps:

1. Data preprocessing: The input text data is preprocessed to remove noise, punctuation, and stopwords. This step also involves tokenization, which converts the text into individual words or tokens.

2. Model training: The Naive Bayes model is trained on a labeled dataset, where each document is associated with a known category or class. During training, the model learns the probabilities of each word occurring in each class, as well as the prior probabilities of each class.

3. Classification: Once the model is trained, it can be used to classify new, unseen text documents. The model calculates the probability of each document belonging to each class based on the occurrence of words in the document and the learned probabilities from the training phase. The document is then assigned to the class with the highest probability.

The Text Classification Using Naive Bayes Model project provides a straightforward and efficient way to perform text classification tasks. It is easy to understand, implement, and customize for different domains and datasets.
